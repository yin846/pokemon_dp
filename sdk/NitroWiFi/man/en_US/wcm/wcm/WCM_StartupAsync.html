#include &lt;nitroWiFi/wcm.h&gt;

s32   WCM_StartupAsync( <A href="WCMConfig.html">WCMConfig</A>* config , <A href="WCMNotify.html">WCMNotify</A> notify );

		<H2>Description</H2>
		<P>
			An asynchronous function that initiates the start sequence for wireless communication features. If the asynchronous process starts normally, the internal state changes from <CODE>WCM_PHASE_WAIT</CODE> to <CODE>WCM_PHASE_WAIT_TO_IDLE</CODE>, and if the asynchronous process completes normally, it becomes <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE>. This function can only be executed in these internal states. The settings specified as an argument are reflected in the library's internal operation only if the function is called when the internal state is <CODE>WCM_PHASE_WAIT</CODE>. The callback function specified with <EM><STRONG><CODE>notify</CODE></STRONG></EM> is called not only when an asynchronous process completion notification is generated by a call of this function, but also every time an asynchronous process completion notification is generated thereafter. When the return value is <CODE>WCM_RESULT_ACCEPT</CODE>, the corresponding asynchronous process notification will be generated once and the callback function is called. 
		</P>

		<H2>Arguments</H2>
		<TABLE border="1">
			<TBODY>
				<TR>
					<TD width="25%"><EM><STRONG><CODE>config</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD width="75%">Specifies the pointer to a WCM library internal operation configuration structure of type <A href="WCMConfig.html"><CODE>WCMConfig</CODE></A>. The DMA number used internally and operation during wireless access point auto-search can be configured. If <CODE>NULL</CODE> is specified, the default configuration values will be used. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>notify</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Designates the callback function called when an asynchronous process notification is generated. If set to <CODE>NULL</CODE>, notification will be disabled. <BR>Note that this callback is called from the interrupt handler. </TD>
				</TR>
			</TBODY>
		</TABLE>

		<H2>Return Values</H2>
		<P>
			Returns one of the following process results. 
		</P>
		<TABLE border="1">
			<TBODY>
				<TR>
					<TD width="25%"><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_ACCEPT</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD width="75%">Indicates that the request to start the asynchronous sequence was accepted and that the asynchronous process started normally. When the asynchronous process ends, the callback function will be called once.   </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_PROGRESS</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that the asynchronous sequence started by this function is already executing and this was a duplicate call. Even with duplicate calls, the asynchronous process completion notification is generated only once. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_SUCCESS</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that the startup sequence for the wireless communication feature has already completed, and the internal state was <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE>. Since the asynchronous process is not started, an asynchronous process completion notification is not generated.</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_FAILURE</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates the process failed because the WCM library was not initialized or the internal state was not <CODE>WCM_PHASE_WAIT</CODE>, <CODE>WCM_PHASE_WAIT_TO_IDLE</CODE>, or <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE>. This value is returned also when the function is unsuccessful in issuing a PXI process request to the ARM7. However, because the internal state becomes <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IRREGULAR</CODE>, no retries are possible. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_WMDISABLE</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>This indicates that the process cannot be executed because the wireless driver is not operating on the ARM7 when the startup of the wireless communications feature was attempted. If the ARM7 component is ichneumon, the wireless driver may have been forcibly stopped by the WVR library. <BR>Also, this value is returned when attempting to execute this process on a Nintendo DS machine that has had wireless communications prohibited. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_FATAL_ERROR</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that an unrecoverable error has occurred. Internal state becomes <CODE>WCM_PHASE_FATAL_ERROR</CODE> and does not change thereafter. </TD>
				</TR>
			</TBODY>
		</TABLE>

		<H2>Asynchronous Process Results</H2>
		<P>
			One of the following asynchronous process results is passed to the callback function specified by <EM><CODE><B>notify</B></CODE></A></EM>. The notification type is always <CODE>WCM_NOTIFY_STARTUP</CODE>.
		</P>
		<TABLE border="1">
			<TBODY>
