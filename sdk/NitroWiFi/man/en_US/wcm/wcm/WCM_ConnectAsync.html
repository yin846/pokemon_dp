		<H2>Description</H2>
		<P>
			An asynchronous function that initiates the sequence to connect to a wireless access point. If the asynchronous process starts normally, the internal state changes from <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE> to <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE_TO_DCF</CODE>; when the asynchronous process completes normally, it becomes <CODE>WCM_PHASE_DCF</CODE>. This function can only be executed in these internal states. The settings specified as an argument are reflected in the library's internal operation only if the function is called when the internal state is <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE>. When the return value is <CODE>WCM_RESULT_ACCEPT</CODE>, the corresponding asynchronous process notification will be generated once and the callback function is called. 
		</P>

					<TD width="25%"><EM><STRONG><CODE>bssDesc</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD width="75%">Specifies information about the wireless access point to connect to as pointer to a <CODE>WMBssDesc</CODE> structure. For the wireless access point information, use the information provided by the auto-search's asynchronous discovery notification or information obtained with the <A href="WCM_PointApList.html"><CODE>WCM_PointApList</CODE> function</A>. </TD>

				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>wepDesc</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Specifies the WEP encryption setting used for connecting to wireless access point as a pointer to a <A href="WCMWepDesc.html"><CODE>WCMWepDesc</CODE> structure</A>  if <CODE>NULL</CODE>, WEP encryption is disabled. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>option</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Specifies 32-bit option update settings in accordance with the option-setting format. For details see the description for <A href="WCM_UpdateOption.html"><CODE>WCM_UpdateOption</CODE></A> function. </TD>
				</TR>
			</TBODY>
		</TABLE>

		<H2>Return Values</H2>
		<P>
			Returns one of the following process results. 
		</P>
		<TABLE border="1">
			<TBODY>
				<TR>
					<TD width="25%"><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_ACCEPT</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD width="75%">Indicates that the request to start the asynchronous sequence was accepted and that the asynchronous process started normally. When the asynchronous process ends, the callback function will be called once.   </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_PROGRESS</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that the asynchronous sequence started by this function is already executing and this was a duplicate call. Even with duplicate calls, the asynchronous process completion notification is generated only once. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_SUCCESS</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that the sequence for connection to a wireless access point has already completed, and the internal state was <CODE>WCM_PHASE_DCF</CODE>. Since the asynchronous process is not started, an asynchronous process completion notification is not generated. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_REJECT</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that when the function attempted to initiate the sequence to connect to a wireless access point, it was not successful in issuing a PXI process request to the ARM7. The internal state remains <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE> and another attempt can be made. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_FAILURE</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates the process failed because the WCM library was not initialized, the internal state was not <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE>, <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE_TO_DCF</CODE>, or <CODE>WCM_PHASE_DCF</CODE>, or valid information is not specified for the argument. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_FATAL_ERROR</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that an unrecoverable error has occurred. Internal state becomes <CODE>WCM_PHASE_FATAL_ERROR</CODE> and does not change thereafter. </TD>
				</TR>
			</TBODY>
		</TABLE>

		<H2>Asynchronous Process Results</H2>
		<P>
			One of the following asynchronous process results is passed to the callback function specified by <A href="WCM_StartupAsync.html"><CODE>WCM_StartupAsync</CODE></A> function. The notification type is always <CODE>WCM_NOTIFY_CONNECT</CODE>. 
		</P>
		<TABLE border="1">
			<TBODY>
				<TR>
					<TD width="25%"><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_SUCCESS</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>

				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_FAILURE</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that an error notification was received from the WM library during the asynchronous process. The internal state becomes <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IRREGULAR</CODE> or returns to <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE>. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_FATAL_ERROR</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>

		<H2>Asynchronous Notification</H2>
		<P>
			While connecting to wireless access point and performing communication, one of the following progress notifications may be issued to the callback function specified with <A><CODE>WCM_StartupAsync</CODE></A> function. <BR>Note that the notification type is the same as that of the asynchronous process result notification for a request to disconnect from wireless access point using the <A href="WCM_DisconnectAsync.html"><CODE>WCM_DisconnectAsync</CODE> function</A>.

					<TD width="25%"><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_NOTIFY_DISCONNECT</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD width="25%"><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_SUCCESS</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD width="50%">Indicates that the system was disconnected from the wireless access point or that there was no beacon received from the wireless access point for a certain period, resulting in a timeout. The connection with the wireless access point is reset and the internal state returns to <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE>. </TD>

				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_NOTIFY_DISCONNECT</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_FAILURE</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>When disconnected from the wireless access point, the function automatically tries to reset the connection with the wireless access point. This indicates that the function received an error notification during the reset process. The internal state becomes <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IRREGULAR</CODE>. </TD>
