		<H2>Description</H2>
		<P>
			An asynchronous function that initiates the sequence to stop the wireless communication functionality. If the asynchronous process starts normally, the internal state changes from <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE> to <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE_TO_WAIT</CODE>; when the asynchronous process completes normally, it becomes <CODE>WCM_PHASE_WAIT</CODE>. This function can only be executed in these internal states. When the return value is <CODE>WCM_RESULT_ACCEPT</CODE>, the corresponding asynchronous process notification is generated once and the callback function is called. 
		</P>


		<H2>Arguments</H2>
		<P>
			None.
		</P>

		<H2>Return Values</H2>
		<P>
			Returns one of the following process results. 
		</P>
		<TABLE border="1">
			<TBODY>
				<TR>
					<TD width="25%"><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_ACCEPT</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD width="75%">Indicates that the request to start the asynchronous sequence was accepted and that the asynchronous process started normally. When the asynchronous process ends, the callback function will be called once.   </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_PROGRESS</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that the asynchronous sequence started by this function is already executing and this was a duplicate call. Even with duplicate calls, the asynchronous process completion notification is generated only once. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_SUCCESS</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that the stop sequence for the wireless communication functionality has already completed, and the internal state was <CODE>WCM_PHASE_WAIT</CODE>. Since the asynchronous process is not started, an asynchronous process completion notification is not generated.</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_REJECT</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that when the function attempted to initiate the sequence to stop the wireless communication functionality, the issue of a PXI process request to the ARM7 failed. The internal state remains <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE> and another attempt can be made. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_FAILURE</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates the process failed because the WCM library was not initialized and the internal state was not <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE>, <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE_TO_WAIT</CODE>, or <CODE>WCM_PHASE_WAIT</CODE>, etc. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_FATAL_ERROR</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that an unrecoverable error has occurred. Internal state becomes <CODE>WCM_PHASE_FATAL_ERROR</CODE> and does not change thereafter. </TD>
				</TR>
			</TBODY>
		</TABLE>

		<H2>Asynchronous Process Results</H2>
		<P>
			One of the following asynchronous process results is passed to the callback function specified by <A href="WCM_StartupAsync.html"><CODE>WCM_StartupAsync</CODE></A> function. The notification type is always <CODE>WCM_NOTIFY_CLEANUP</CODE>.
		</P>
		<TABLE border="1">
			<TBODY>
				<TR>
					<TD width="25%"><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_SUCCESS</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
