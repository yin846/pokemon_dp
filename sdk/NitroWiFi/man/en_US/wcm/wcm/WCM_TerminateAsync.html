		<H2>Description</H2>
		<P>
			An asynchronous function that starts the WCM library's forced-stop sequence from an internal state in which there is no asynchronous processing. If the asynchronous process starts without problems, the internal state changes to <CODE>WCM_PHASE_TERMINATING</CODE>, and if the asynchronous process completes without problems, it becomes <CODE>WCM_PHASE_WAIT</CODE>. The state does not return to its pre-initialization state. This function can be executed when the internal state is <CODE>WCM_PHASE_WAIT</CODE>, <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IDLE</CODE>, <CODE>WCM_PHASE_SEARCH</CODE>, <CODE>WCM_PHASE_DCF</CODE>, or <CODE>WCM_PHASE_IRREGULAR</CODE>. But it cannot be executed when an asynchronous process is executing or when the state is <CODE>WCM_PHASE_FATAL_ERROR</CODE>. When the return value is <CODE>WCM_RESULT_ACCEPT</CODE>, the corresponding asynchronous process notification will be generated once and the callback function is called. 
		</P>

		<H2>Arguments</H2>
		<P>
			None.
		</P>

		<H2>Return Values</H2>
		<P>
			Returns one of the following process results.

		<TABLE border="1">
			<TBODY>
				<TR>
					<TD width="25%"><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_ACCEPT</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD width="75%">Indicates that the request to start the asynchronous sequence was accepted and that the asynchronous process started normally. When the asynchronous process ends, the callback function is called once.   </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_PROGRESS</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that the asynchronous sequence started by this function is already executing and this was a duplicate call. Even with duplicate calls, the asynchronous process completion notification is generated only once. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_SUCCESS</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that the forced stop sequence for the WCM library has already completed, and the internal state is <CODE>WCM_PHASE_WAIT</CODE>. Since the asynchronous process is not started, an asynchronous process completion notification is not generated.</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_REJECT</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that the PXI process request to the ARM7 failed when the function attempted to initiate the WCM library's forced-stop sequence. Because the internal state is not changed since this function is called, retry is possible. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_FAILURE</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates the process failed because the WCM library was not initialized or the internal state was not suitable for execution. </TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_FATAL_ERROR</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
					<TD>Indicates that an unrecoverable error has occurred. Internal state becomes <CODE>WCM_PHASE_FATAL_ERROR</CODE> and does not change thereafter. </TD>
				</TR>

		<H2>Asynchronous Process Results</H2>
		<P>
			One of the following asynchronous process results is passed to the callback function specified by <A href="WCM_StartupAsync.html"><CODE>WCM_StartupAsync</CODE></A> function. The notification type is always <CODE>WCM_NOTIFY_TERMINATE</CODE>.
		</P>
		<TABLE border="1">

				<TR>
					<TD width="25%"><EM><STRONG><CODE>WCM_RESULT_SUCCESS</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
