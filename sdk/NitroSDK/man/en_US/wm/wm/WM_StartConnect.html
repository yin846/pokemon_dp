<h2>Return Values</h2>
<p>Returns the results of the <CODE><A href="WMErrCode.html">WMErrCode</A></CODE> enumerated type process.</p>

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This function initiates a connection process to a parent. This function is executable only when the WM is in the <code>IDLE</code> state. If the return value for API is <code>WM_ERRCODE_OPERATING</code>, a callback is triggered when the connection process starts, when the request is approved by the parent, and AID was allocated. The callback is also generated when the normal connection state could not be achieved after starting the connection process. When the connection is complete, the WM changes to the <code>CHILD</code> state. After the connection is established, the callback specified by this function is generated when the device is disconnected from the parent. The callback that was specified with this function is also generated if the beacon that was transmitted by the parent on a periodic basis was not received after a set period of time. Call <a href="WM_Reset.html"><code>WM_Reset</code></a> before re-calling <code>WM_StartConnect</code>.</P>

<h2>Note</h2>
<P>
After calling this function, a callback will be generated when the connection as a child device completes as expected, but sometimes before the callback is generated a notification will be generated  that shows that  there was a beacon receive notification or a disconnect from the parent device. When performing an initialization process, etc., as the child device, perform it before this function is called rather than when the callback has been generated.
