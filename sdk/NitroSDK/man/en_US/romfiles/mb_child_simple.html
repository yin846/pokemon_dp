<H2>Description</H2>
<CODE>mb_child_simple</CODE> is a test program that displays several debug information items and conducts DS download play. This program downloads programs without checking the authentication codes, so during development it should be used in testing, etc.<br> A release version and a ROM version of this program have been prepared, but their only difference is a text output to the debugger. Also, when there is no need to trace in detail the child device-side internal state of the DS download play process, we recommend that you use <CODE><a href="mb_child.html">mb_child</a></CODE>, which is the same sort of test program and is closer to the release version.
<H2>Operation Method</H2>
At startup, &quot;PUSH A TO START&quot; will be displayed. Pressing the A Button will scan the DS Single-Card Play parent device and display a list of discovered game information. The chart below discusses each item on the screen:
<TABLE border="1" width="100%">

      <TD width="800">
