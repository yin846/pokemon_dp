<H2>Description</H2>
<P>These are the enumerator types representing the results of the file system API and the user procedures of the archive.<br />They are defined as follows.
<TABLE border="0">
  <TBODY>
    <TR>
<TD colspan="2">The following are used both for execution results of API and for user procedure return values.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
<TD>FS_RESULT_SUCCESS</TD>
<TD>Indicates success in correctly processing results.<br /><br />Example: <code>FS_ReadFile</code> attempts to read file, <code>foo.dat</code>, which contains <code>100 BYTE</code>s of data&hellip; but reached the end after only being able to read <code>50 BYTE</code>s, this is normal behavior and so is treated as a &quot;success&quot;.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
<TD>FS_RESULT_FAILURE</TD>
<TD>Indicates failure to correctly process results.<br />Example: This indicates a failure in the expected return value for the process when you have read to the end using <code>FS_ReadDir</code> function.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
<TD>FS_RESULT_ERROR</TD>
<TD>Indicates failure in the results where a detectable error occurred during processing.<br />Indicates an unrecognized error, such as a problem in the argument range, or the occurrence of a <code>NULL</code> pointer during processing.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
<TD>FS_RESULT_UNSUPPORTED</TD>
<TD>Indicates that the archive is not supported by the specified command.<br />This error occurs when an unsupported archive is explicitly returned as a return value of a user procedure.<br />The user must understand the particular specifications of the target archive.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
<TD colspan="2"><br />The following are only returned as the results of API execution.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
<TD>FS_RESULT_BUSY</TD>
<TD>Indicates that the current command is busy.<br />Strictly speaking, this is not an error because the operation is incomplete. However, we have included this with the errors for the sake of convenience.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
<TD>FS_RESULT_CANCELED</TD>
<TD>Indicates that the command was canceled.<br /><br />There are two types of cancels: explicit command cancel by the user forced cancel during archive unload</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
<TD colspan="2"><br />The following are used only as user procedure return values:</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
<TD>FS_RESULT_PROC_ASYNC</TD>
<TD>Return value when the user procedure returns a temporary control for asynchronous processing.<br />When this value is returned, you must notify the read/write callback as well as the process completion using the <code>FS_NotifyArchiveAsyncEnd</code> function.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
<TD>FS_RESULT_PROC_DEFAULT</TD>
<TD>The default return value passed to a user procedure. This is the value passed unless a different value/type is called expicitly. The user procedure for the corresponding command will be called the next time as well. If you simply want to hook a command, this value is returned every time.</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
<TD>FS_RESULT_PROC_UNKNOWN</TD>
<TD>The default return value passed to a user procedure when the procedure call flag to the associated command is canceled. The command will not be called again.</TD>
    </TR>
  </TBODY>
</TABLE>
