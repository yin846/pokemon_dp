<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This function asynchronously loads data from a device that has ROM. The access bus must be locked before using this function.<BR> If a valid DMA channel is specified, this function uses that channel after explicitly stopping it with the <code><a href="../../mi/dma/MI_StopDma.html">MI_StopDma</a></code> function.<BR> If the previous access has not completed, this function waits until the previous access completes.<BR> <BR> If this function explicitly specifies CPU transfer, it behaves the same as the synchronous version, the <code><a href="CARD_ReadRom.html">CARD_ReadRom</a></code> function.<BR> In the old version of this function, the transfer source, transfer destination, and transfer size were restricted by hardware. These restrictions no longer exist. <BR>
</P>
<H2>Note</H2>
<p>
<FONT color="#800000">If a valid DMA channel is specified by this function, that DMA channel will not be available until transfer is complete.<BR> Note that because this function uses interrupts internally, the process will not complete if it attempts to run while interrupts are prohibited.<BR></FONT></p>
<h2>Internal Operation</h2>
<p><CODE>This function operates asynchronously using DMA transfers and the IRQ handler only if the following conditions are satisfied: <BR>In that case, transfers of card data can be done in parallel with CPU processing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The transfer destination range can be accessed by DMA and is 32-byte aligned.<br>
<li>The  transfer source range is aligned to <A href="../card_rom_page_size_const.html">CARD_ROM_PAGE_SIZE</A> bytes.
<li>The  transfer size is aligned to <A href="../card_rom_page_size_const.html">CARD_ROM_PAGE_SIZE</A> bytes. <br>
</ul>
<p>If these conditions are not all met, the process will be executed asynchronously by a CPU process using a CARD library internal thread regardless of whether DMA transfer has been specified or not.<br>For more information on this thread, see the description for the <code><A href="../common/CARD_GetThreadPriority.html">CARD_GetThreadPriority </A></code> function. <br><br> Here are some main points you need to be aware of with the application in order to ensure that the conditions for DMA transfer are satisfied:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not specify an automatic variable as transfer destination. (By default, the stack is allocated from DTCM, so DMA access is impossible.)
<li>Specify Align or AlignAll in the RomSpec section of the RSF file, and place the file so it has 512 byte alignment.
<li>If the size of the file is not an integral multiple of 512 bytes, divide up the file so it is read in segments that are integral multiples of 512 bytes.
</ul>
<BR></CODE></p>
