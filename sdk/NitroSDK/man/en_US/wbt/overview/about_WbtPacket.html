The figure below shows the packet flow during dowload and upload when using WBT.<BR> <BR> <FONT color="red"><B>(Note) Since half-duplex communications are used between parents and children, if an upload and download occur at the same time, the upload takes priority as seen from the child.</B></FONT><BR>

<P>
Although processing flow is essentially only reversed between parent and child as compared to a download, the child must notify the parent by sending block information using WBT_PutUserData when child wants to upload because the upload must be performed as a download to the parent. (If the upload timing is immediately after RequestSync and blocks to be uploaded are fixed, the WBT_GetBlockInfo function may be called as the RequestSync receive callback.Åj<BR> The following figure shows the packet flow exchanged between parent and child during upload.<BR>
