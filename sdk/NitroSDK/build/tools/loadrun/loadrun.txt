loadrun is a command that loads and executes NITRO srl files associated with IS-NITRO-EMULATOR.
It can be run from the command line without starting the debugger, and can be forcibly terminated with settings conditions.

----------------------------------------------------------------
How to use:
Specify the srl filename after loadrun.
At that time, options can be specified between loadrun and the srl filename. See the following for options.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation of options.

--version
	Displays the version.

-h, --help
	Displays help.

-q, --quiet
	Runs in Quiet mode.
	OS_Printf() from the DS is not displayed.

-v, --verbose
	Runs in Verbose mode.
	Displays various information.

-L, --list
	Displays a list of connected devices.
	For example, a list such as the following is displayed.

	---- Connected devices:
	  0: [NITROUSB]  IS-NITRO-EMULATOR serial:04070680
	  1: [NITROUSB]  IS-NITRO-EMULATOR serial:04070682
	  2: [NITROUSB]  IS-NITRO-EMULATOR serial:04070683
	3 device(s) found.

	The [NITROUSB] portion is whatever device type specified with the &ndash;d option. serial is the serial number specified by using the -s option.

Devices that are already connected when IS-NITRO-DEBUGGER is started are not displayed in this list.

-l, --lap
	Displays the elapsed time since startup on each row when OS_Printf() data is displayed. Operations are executed in units of seconds internally, so there may be slight variations of a few tenths of a second.
	The below is an example of what is displayed. The {x:xx} portion is the portion added by this option.

	{0:01}Program started
	{0:01}--- heap init
	{0:02}x=14 y=50
	{0:04}x=15 y=20
	{0:04}

-d, --type=DEVICE
	Specifies device types. CGBUSB, CGBSCSI, NITROUSB, or NITROUIC can be specified.
The first machine found with the device specified here becomes the target for that action.


-s, --serial=SERIAL
	Specifies device serial numbers. The specified value is a 10 digit number and is the same as the serial number displayed with the -L option.
	(In the list, when displaying 04070680, the first 0 can be eliminated as in 4010680.
The first machine found with the serial number specified here becomes the target for that action.

	It is okay to specify only one of either &ndash;d or &ndash;s.
It is also okay to specify both, or neither.
If absolutely nothing is specified, the first machine found period becomes the target.

-t, --timeout=SECOND
	Specifies a display timeout.
	After receiving the last OS_Printf() data, if the next display doesn&rsquo;t come by the specified time, the operation is forcibly terminated.


-T, --exec-timeout=SECOND
	Specifies an execution timeout.
	Forcibly terminates after the specified period of time passes from when debugger loads an executes an srl file.	 

-a, --abort-string=STRING
	Specifies a termination character string.
	-a=ABORT  -a=&quot;ABORT&quot;   -a ABORT -a &quot;ABORT&quot;
These can be specified using forms such as --abort-string=ABORT  and  --abort-string &quot;ABORT.&quot;

	Matching checks the beginning of the displayed character string. It will not make a determination until a line feed is found.	  Gaps between displays are fine.

	For example, if the termination character string is &ldquo;ABORT,&quot; any of the following
	OS_Printf(&quot;   ABORT\n&quot;)
	OS_Printf(&quot;ABORTING\n&quot;)
	OS_Printf(&quot;ABOR&quot;); OS_Sleep(1000); OS_Printf(&quot;T\n&quot;) will result in termination.

	OS_Printf(&quot;   ABORT\n&quot;)
	OS_Printf(&quot;ABO\nRT\n&quot;)
	OS_Printf(&quot;A B O R T\n&quot;): These will not result in termination, however. In addition,

	OS_Printf(&quot;ABORT&quot;)

	will not immediately terminate because a line break has not been added.
	Termination will occur after OS_Printf(&quot;\n&quot;), OS_Printf(&quot; SOON\n&quot;), or other line feed code is encountered later.

-c, --card-slot=SWITCH
	Specify the lock setting of the card slot to ON or OFF when executing.
	OFF is used if unspecified.

-C, --cartridge-slot=SWITCH
	Specify the lock setting of the cartridge to ON or OFF when executing.
	OFF is used if unspecified.
