<H1>Basic Rules for Naming Functions and Variables</H1>
<H2>Category</H2>
<P>Nitro SDK functions can be classified into categories according to their application and they have been given names that help make this clear.</P>
<DL>
<DT>Category
<DD>These consist of two or more continuous uppercase letters. (Numerals can also be used, but for graphics only.)
  <DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<TABLE border="1" width="100%">
  <COL span="1" width="100">
  <TBODY>
    <TR>

<TD>Items related to the OS system.</TD>

<P align="left">Note: The distinction in the main processor and subprocessor categories was eliminated and all caps are used uniformly.</P>
<P align="right">(04/01/18)</P>
<H2>Functions</H2>
<P>Functions are named as follows: Subject and object connected without an underscore with the first letter of each separate word capitalized.</P>
<DL>
<DT>Public functions (API)
<DD>[Category name]_[verb] [object, etc]
  <DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Example: OS_SetInterruptMask, OS_IsLocked</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Private functions
<DD>[Category name]i_[verb] [object, etc]
  <DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Example: OSi_SetInterruptMaskBase</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>static functions
<DD>freely
</DL>
<P>However, there are some functions that do not traditionally follow this rule, such as <CODE>OS_InterruptHandler</CODE>.  </P>
<P align="right">(03/11/13)</P>
<P>There are two methods available for deciding the name of a function that generates and/or initializes objects. One is <CODE>Create</CODE> and the other is <CODE>Init</CODE>. In this case, <CODE>Create</CODE> is used when a function for explicitely destroying the object must be called, while <CODE>Init</CODE> is used when disposal processing is not required.</P>
<P align="right">(03/12/15)</P>
<H2>Variable Type Name</H2>
<P>Functions and types are the same since the name used in typedefs fundamentally adhere to GAMECUBE conventions. Note that a verb is not used after the category name.</P>
<DL>
<DT>Variable type name
<DD>[Category name] [noun]
  <DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Example: OSInterruptCallback</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Variable name (exception)
<DD>[Category name] [verb] Mode
  <DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Example: OSCopyMode</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<P>As an exception, names such as <CODE>OSCopyMode</CODE> given above are included for functions used to control the operations of the API itself. In this case, the function is likely to control the operations of a function having a name like <CODE>GXCopy</CODE>. Names such as <CODE>GXCopyStatus</CODE> and <CODE>GXCopyType</CODE> are also conceivable for a function like this. Although this is recognized as a natural way to name such functions, do not take this concept too far.</P>
<P align="right">(03/11/13)</P>
<H2>Enumerator Names and Macro Names</H2>
<P>Constants defined by <CODE>enum</CODE>, <CODE>define</CODE>, and <CODE>const</CODE> will have the format shown below.</P>
<DL>
<DT>Constant Name
<DD>[Category name] _ [A-Z0-9_]+
  <DD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Example: OS_INTERRUPT_MAX, OS_INTERRUPT_MAX</BLOCKQUOTE>
