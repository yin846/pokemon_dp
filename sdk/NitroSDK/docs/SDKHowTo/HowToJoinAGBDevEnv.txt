	Making it possible for the NITRO-SDK environment and the AGBSDK environment to coexist.

You can use mount in Cygwin to map any directory to the top of a single directory tree and use it as a virtual path.

When you use this virtual path in the AGBGNUPro environment that comes with the AGBSDK, if you install Cygwin, it is possible that a new installation of Cygwin will overwrite the mount position of the root directory of the virtual path in the AGBGNUPro environment, which will cause a problem.

We have confirmed that if the path descriptions to the AGB libraries (in the AGB development environment PATH settings, Makefile, etc) are formatted so that they do not use virtual paths, a new Cygwin will run properly, and coexistence with the NITRO-SDK will be possible.

If a new installation of Cygwin causes problems with a build in the AGB environment, first, confirm that the environment variable settings for AGBDIR and PATH (found in AgbGNUProBash.bat, AgbGNUProDos.bat, Makefile, etc.) match directory names to the AGB environment.

(Supplemental) Concerning setting NITROSDK_ROOT in the .bashrc and other environment setting files:

If you set NITROSDK_ROOT with a virtual path from where Cygwin is installed, there will be times that the path that is passed to the compiler, etc as an option, will not be passed properly.

Therefore, always set an absolute path from the drive name, as shown below.

	"C:/(path to NitroSDK)"

  or

	"C:\(path to NitroSDK)"
