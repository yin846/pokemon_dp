* Adding BG bank combinations

1. Changes to gx_vramcnt.h

- Add the BG entry (GX_VRAM_BG_nnn_xxx) to GXVRamBG.

    Validity flags are, in order from the bottom bit, ABCDEFG.
    Set the appropriate flags.

     The format is GX_VRAM_BG_(size)_(bank) = (validity flag for bank)
    
- Use GX_VRAM_BG_ASSERT(x) to add the BG entry to the criteria.

    Check whether the bank combination is valid.

    Add in this format: (x) == GX_VRAM_BG_nnn_xxx || \


2. Changes to gx_vramcnt.c

- Add the BG entry to GX_VRAMCNT_SetBG_()

    Add a description for each bank control register that you will use.
    Set so that the banks you use are mapped to consecutive VRAM addresses.


3. Changes to gxstat.c

- Add the BG entry to GX_RegionCheck_BG_()

    This describes a check of whether the VRAM addresses you are using are valid.
    Pass the BG_VRAM start address and end address respectively to the first and second arguments of SDK_REGION_ASSERT.


* Add OBJ bank combinations

1. Changes to gx_vramcnt.h

- Add the OBJ entry (GX_VRAM_OBJ_nnn_xxx) to GXVRamOBJ.

    Validity flags are, in order from the bottom bit, ABCDEFG.
    Set the appropriate flags. However you cannot set CD.

     The format is GX_VRAM_OBJ_(size)_(bank) = (validity flag for bank)

    
- Use GX_VRAM_OBJ_ASSERT(x) to add the OBJ entry to the criteria.

    Check whether the bank combination is valid.

    Add in this format: (x) == GX_VRAM_OBJ_nnn_xxx || \


2. Changes to gx_vramcnt.c

- Add the OBJ entry to GX_VRAMCNT_SetOBJ_().

    Add a description for each bank control register that you will use.
    Set so that the banks you use are mapped to consecutive VRAM addresses.


3. Changes to gxstat.c

- Add the OBJ entry to GX_RegionCheck_OBJ_().

    This describes a check of whether the VRAM addresses you are using are valid.
    Pass the BG_VRAM start address and end address respectively to the first and second arguments of SDK_REGION_ASSERT.
