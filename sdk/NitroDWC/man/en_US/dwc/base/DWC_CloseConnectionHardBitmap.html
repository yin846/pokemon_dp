int DWC_CloseConnectionHardBitmap( u32* bitmap );</CODE></PRE>

<H2>Description</H2>
    <P>
Forces the connection with the specified AID to close. Close process completes within this function. Each time a close operation for one AID is completed, the callback function set with the <CODE><a href="DWC_SetConnectionClosedCallback.html">DWC_SetConnectionClosedCallback</a></CODE> function is called before exiting this function.
    </P>
	<P>
	  The other host is also notified of this close, and the close callback <a href="DWCConnectionClosedCallback.html">DWCConnectionClosedCallback</a> is called on the other host. However, because this close notification is only sent once by UDP communications, it is possible, depending on the conditions of the connection, that the notification will not reach its destination.
	</P>
    <P>
Use this function to handle unusual situations&mdash;for example, closing the connection of a host when communication has become impossible because the host has been turned off.
    </P>
	<P>
	  If you use the <a href="DWC_CloseConnectionHard.html">DWC_CloseConnectionHard</a> function, you can specify an individual AID and close the connection.

<H2>Arguments</H2>
    <TABLE border="1">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
<TD width="25%"><EM><STRONG><CODE>bitmap</CODE></STRONG></EM></TD>
<TD>Provides a pointer to the region where the AID bitmap of the host to be closed is stored. After the close operation is completed, only the value (bitmap) created by the bit of the AID that actually closed successfully is stored and returned to the reference destination of this pointer. At that time, your own AID bit is always 0.</TD>
