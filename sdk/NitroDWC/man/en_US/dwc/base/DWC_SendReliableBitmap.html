u32 DWC_SendReliableBitmap( u32 bitmap,
                            const void* buffer,
                            int size );</CODE></PRE>

<H2>Description</H2>
		<P>
		  After matchmaking completes, this function performs Reliable send via UDP to multiple AIDs using the AID bitmap specified in <CODE>bitmap</CODE>.
		</P>
        <P>
With Reliable send, data is delivered to the communications partner in the order it was sent, with no duplication or packet loss. However, it will take longer for the send to complete, since each packet is checked when it arrives.
        </P>
		<P>
		  If data sending is impeded on a layer lower than the DWC, the data is stored in the send buffer with the size specified by the <A href="DWC_InitFriendsMatch.html">DWC_InitFriendsMatch</A> function. If there is not enough space in the send buffer and a Reliable sending is attempted, the data that could not be sent is stored as is and is sent from the <A href="DWC_ProcessFriendsMatch.html">DWC_ProcessFriendsMatch</A> function as soon as space opens up in the send buffer.
		</P>
		<P>
		  Also, the maximum data size that can be sent at one time is determined (the default is 1465 bytes). If data larger than this is sent, the send data is divided up, and the send is suspended. The maximum data size can be changed with the <A href="DWC_SetSendSplitMax.html"><CODE>DWC_SetSendSplitMax</CODE></A> function. To maintain compatibility with differently configured communications devices, try not to set the size above the default.
		</P>
		<P>
		  While the send data is suspended in this manner, do not delete the send buffer. Also, no further data can be sent during the suspension.
		</P>
		<P>
		  It is possible to check whether or not a Reliable send is possible, including whether there is empty send buffer space and if the send destination AID is valid, by using the <A href="DWC_IsSendableReliable.html">DWC_IsSendableReliable</A> function.
		</P>
		<P>
		  When the send completion callback is configured with the <A href="DWC_SetUserSendCallback.html">DWC_SetUserSendCallback</A> function, the callback is called when the data send is complete. However, the send completion being referred to here is only for when data has been passed to a low-layer send function and does not mean when the data arrives at the communication partner.
		</P>
		<P>
		  The AID bitmap of a connected DS can be obtained with the <A href="DWC_GetAIDList.html"><CODE>DWC_GetAIDBitmap</CODE></A> function.
		</P>
		<P>
		  By using the <a href="DWC_SendReliable.html">DWC_SendReliable</a> function, a Reliable send can be made with multiple values assigned to an AID.
		</P>

<H2>Return Values</H2>
    <p>
Bitmap in which the AID bits are set for successful transmission preparations. If the device's own AID bit is set and passed to an argument, the bit remains set.<BR>There is a failure when an error occurs, the previous send process does not end, an invalid AID is specified, or there is not enough space in the send buffer.
