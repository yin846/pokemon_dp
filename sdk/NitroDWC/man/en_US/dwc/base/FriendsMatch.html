<H2>Description</H2>
	<P>
	  The FriendsMatch Library is a term that describes the collection of features that are also in the DWC Library. These include connection to Wi-Fi Connection, processes for establishing friend relationships, matchmaking, exchange of data between DS devices, and access to the data storage servers. In the function list of this reference manual, the [Friend Management / Matchmaking Processes] category of functions is included in the FriendsMatch Library.
	</P>
	<P>
	  The period during which the FriendsMatch Library is running represents the interval between when the <a href="DWC_InitFriendsMatch.html"><CODE>DWC_InitFriendsMatch</CODE></a> function is called and when the <a href="DWC_ShutdownFriendsMatch.html"><CODE>DWC_ShutdownFriendsMatch</CODE></a> function is called. The phrase &quot;FriendsMatch Library&quot; is primarily used to indicate this interval.
