mwCVS
=====
mwCVS is a free plugin for the CodeWarrior IDE.  It allows you 
to use common CVS commands without leaving the CodeWarrior IDE.  
CVS is an open source version control system specifically geared for 
source code and project management.  
mwCVS was designed to mirror the GNU CVS functionality as closely as possible. 

=============================
Changes
=============================
 
Bugs related to the modified state of files, as well as UI issues fixed.  

=============================
System Requirements
=============================
 - CodeWarrior IDE version 5.2 or higher
 - cvs.exe and cwspawn.exe installed in the IDE's (Helper Apps) folder 
 - mwcvs.dll installed in the IDE's plugins/version control folder
 - pMWCVS.dll installed in the IDE's plugins/Preference Panel folder


========================
Installation information:
========================
To use the mwCVS plugin for the Windows  CodeWarrior IDE, 4 components are
necessary: mwcvs.dll, pMWCVS.dll, cvs.exe, and cwspawn.exe.  Relative
to IDE.exe, mwcvs.dll is installed in .\plugins\Version Control,
pMWCVS.dll is installed in .\plugins\Preference Panel, cvs.exe is 
installed in ..\(Helper Apps), and RunHelper.exe is installed in the 
same directory as IDE.exe.


==================
Setup Information:
==================
To setup mwCVS, choose Version Control Settings from the Edit menu.  Click
The "Use Version Control" check box and select mwCVS from the Method drop 
down menu.  Set global options as desired in the mwCVS preference panel.

NOTE: When no project is open, the settings are the global settings, and
checking the "use global settings as default" check box will cause all
projects without overriding project-level settings to use the global settings.
When a project is open, the settings are project-level only.
NOTE: Project level settings do not have the "use global..." checkbox.
Setting project-level settings will override the global settings.

=============================
How mwCVS Works
=============================
mwCVS uses the cvs.exe command line tool installed in the IDE's help apps folder
to execute commands.  The output of each cvs command is shown in a CodeWarrior 
IDE editor window.


===========
GNU CVS.EXE
===========
The application cvs.exe is distributed under the terms of the GNU
Public License, see www.gnu.org.  Source files for the patches to this
application can be obtained by sending mail to support@metrowerks.com or from 
the mwCVS web site (see below).


=============================
CVS Environmental Variables
=============================
CVSREAD: mwCVS explicitly tells cvs whether to make new files read-only each time a 
command is executed using the -w and -r command line flags.  The CVSREAD variable 
is therefore overridden by mwCVS.  You can set mwCVS' preference panel to make 
files read-only be default.

CVSROOT: mwCVS overrides the CVSROOT environmental variable when a Checkout command 
is executed with the checkout directory setting in the Checkout dialog box or when 
a Login command is executed.

CVSEDITOR, EDITOR: mwCVS does not support the CVSEDITOR or EDITOR environmental 
variables.

Other CVS enironmental variables work as described in the GNU CVS documentation.


=============
Known issues:
=============

	=============================
	No CVS.EXE
	=============================
	If CVS.EXE can't be found, no error message is displayed.  CVS.EXE
	should be installed in the (Helper Apps) folder in the same directory
	that holds the folder bin.  If this folder is not found an error message
	will be displayed, but the command will still attempt to execute in hopes
	your OS can locate CVS.EXE.

  	=============================
	CVS Remove Command
	=============================
	mwCVS Remove Dialog gives the option of committing removals immediately and
	the option to delete the file on disk as part of the CVS remove operation 
	(which are enabled by default).  With GNU CVS the default is not to remove 
	the local file with the remove command and to require a separate cvs commit
	after a successfull cvs add.  The file must be deleted from disk before
	a successful cvs remove command but after the file is removed, the IDE 
	won't be able to find the file in order to commit it.
	
	=============================
	Log text edit field in Add Dialog
	=============================
	A known problem exists with current versions of cvs server in that while 
	the log message of the Add dialog (equivalent to cvs add -m "Log Message")
	is transmitted to the cvs repostiory, the add log message can not be 
	retrieved from client-side CVS using the cvs log or cvs status commands.  
	The add dialog log edit field abstracts cvs's client side interface.  If 
	and when the cvs server issue is cleared up (and cvs repisotories and/or 
	software are possibly upgraded) then the cvs log text edit field in the Add
	Dialog window should work as expected.

Frequently Asked Questions
=============================
Q. I am new to CVS.  How can I learn more about CVS and the mwCVS plugin?
A. There are many resources on the web that document CVS.  mwCVS is designed to 
conform the GNU CVS feature set.  See the Internet Resources below.

Q. I do not have a CVS repository.  How can I get my sources in a CVS repository?
A. There are several different ways to set up a CVS repository.  After you have 
set up a repository you probably will want to use the CVS import command from the 
command line to put your files in CVS for the first time.  Refer to the GNU CVS 
documentation for a full discussion on these issues.  After you have imported your
sources, you can issue a checkout command from the mwCVS menu.  You can then use
the other mwCVS commands on those sources.
