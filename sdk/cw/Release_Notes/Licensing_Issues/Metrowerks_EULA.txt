1. Grant of License. This software including application, demonstration, system and all other software accompanying this License, whether electronically distributed or distributed on CD-ROM or any other media (the "Software") and the related documentation are licensed to you by Metrowerks according to the terms of this License. If you purchased or otherwise received this Software packaged with any other host-platform versions of the same software (e.g., a Macintosh® hosted version with a Windows® hosted version), all such host-platform versions together shall constitute the "Software" for purposes of this License.  This License allows you to use each host-platform version of the Software on a single computer corresponding to that host-platform version, provided that you are the only individual using the Software. If you have purchased a concurrent users license (i.e., Floating or Server License), you may install the Software on a common storage device that is accessible by multiple devices provided that you have a software mechanism that locks out any concurrent users in excess of the number of licensed copies of the Software. One backup copy of the software may be made solely as a part of the routine backup activities of your company or business, you are not licensed to make additional copies. You may not transfer to another party any of your license rights in the Software and related documentation by any means. If this Software is an update, patch, error correction or upgrade to a prior version, then you must be licensed to use the prior version of the Software in order to exercise the license rights granted hereunder and you agree all previous licenses are hereby replaced by this license.  If you are a corporation or other organization, you must designate one individual to have the rights provided herein.

2. Restrictions. The Software contains copyrighted material, trade secrets, and other proprietary material of Metrowerks and its licensors. You agree that in order to protect those proprietary materials, except as expressly permitted by applicable legislation, you will not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise reduce all or any part of the Software to human-readable form unless Metrowerks provided it to you in human-readable form.  You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, distribute or create derivative works based upon the Software in whole or in part, except as expressly permitted in Section 3.  If the Software is labeled as an academic version or is otherwise licensed to you for academic use, you may not use the Software for commercial product development, but you may use the Software to develop freeware or shareware within your academic community only.

You may distribute Distributable Code incorporated in such applications to end users directly or indirectly through dealers, distributors, VARs, OEMs and other relicensors, but all distribution, whether to end users or relicensors, must be made pursuant to a valid written agreement that is at least as protective of Metrowerks' and Metrowerks' licensors' rights as this License.

In the event you distribute such portions of the Software based upon express authorization by one of the two means stated, you must adhere strictly to the specific terms of such authorization in addition to the terms of this license. You agree to indemnify and hold Metrowerks harmless from any damages, costs, or expenses Metrowerks may suffer as a result of your distribution, under either of the forms of permission described in the previous sentence, of any portion of the Software owned by a third party.
