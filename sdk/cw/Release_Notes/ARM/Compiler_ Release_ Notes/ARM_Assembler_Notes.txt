1.0 Build 0013 (12-17-2003) :
- Fixed command line driver error about missing panel

1.0 Build 0014 (03-22-2004) :

".option no_section_resume on | off | reset" controls this feature

data to allow them to be placed in individual sections:
	.text
	.global main
main:				; an entry point
	bl	keep
	.text			; start a new entry of .text section
	.global keep
keep:				; keep by linker since it was refefred
	bx	lr
	.text			; start a new entry of .text sectoin
	.global throwaway
throwaway:			; not referred by anyone, linker throw this away
	bx	lr
	
1.0 Build 0016 (03-25-2004):
- replace -debug by -g and address an issue from command line framework
that undo our debugging option

1.0 Build 0019 (03-28-2005):

- Fixed MTWX17414, debugger cannot show assembler source with elf made by CW
Assembler modified so that .dwarf.<funcname>  and .dwarf_line.<funcname> symbols 
are emitted to support assembler source debugging.

- Fixed MTWX17682, Request for support GAS compatible local label in mwasmarm.exe
The assembler now accept multi-digit local labels, e.g. 1000:, whereas previously,
only single digit local labels (0: - 9:) were accepted.

- Fixed MTWX17709, str r2,value syntax is not supported in arm standalone assembler
You may now store a register value to an address specified with a label.
