===========================================================================
Changes in This Version
===========================================================================

- fixed MTWX19434, the linker now emits error when a section name is used
  more than once in the LCF.

  place-holder DWARF2 class type entries from real class type
  entries.


2.0 Build 0074 (08-10-2005) :
- fixed a bug where DWARF2 base types referenced by DWARF2 typedef entries
  get dead-stripped.

- updated linker to keep DWARF2 typedef entries from being dead-stripped.


2.0 Build 0072 (05-12-2005) :
- fixed MTWX18248, application error when disassembler specific object file
- fixed MTWX18284, wrong veneer is generated in NITRO SDK demos.

- fixed warning about missing Nitro_Debug_Setting panel in the command line
  NITRO linker.

  order.

  to use library search paths in revers order.
- fixed MTWX15093, when using command line linker with "-overlaygroup" and
  not specifying files with "-overlay", error message is not meaningful.
  Command line linker now emits error about missing overlay.


2.0 Build 0068 (09-17-2004) :
